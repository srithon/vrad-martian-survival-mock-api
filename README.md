# VRAD Mock API

VRAD's editor lacks autocomplete, useful keybindings and accessible documentation.

This repo mirrors the VRAD API so that you can write VRAD code using a regular IDE. Every function uses type annotations and doc-strings to make VRAD development less painful.

Keep in mind that you can't yet run your code locally, as the functions are only stubs.

## Usage

1. Clone/Extract this repository into your project folder
2. Create your own scripts in the same folder and write code as you normally would
3. To test your code, copy it back into the VRAD IDE and run it normally
